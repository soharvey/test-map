Her works were published by her husband's newspaper and later collected into two volumes: <em>Town and Trail</em> and <em>A Woman in the West</em>. Her vignettes on daily Edmonton life offer a fascinating glimpse of a growing settler city at the turn of the 20th century. The unique sense of place in Watt's writing was a deliberate choice, as she was interested in documenting \"the now\" of things. She also added poems, photos, and drawings to enrich her sensory style.<br></div><div><br></div><div>By mapping Watt's colorful writing in the digital realm, we hope to illustrate her life in the same multimedia way she did. In particular, Watt focused on the people, places, and progress made in \nthe newly-anointed City of Edmonton. We wish to explore these three themes as well, asking who and what was in Edmonton at the time, and what a city of progress looked like in the early 1900s.</div><div><br></div><div>However, we also want to remind our viewers that Watt was a settler woman with many privileges afforded to her. As with all good historical research, we will be introducing other primary sources to supplement Watt's narratives where we can. Watt was progressive for her time in some ways and drew attention to marginalized narratives herself, but her biases are still firmly apparent. We hope that by drawing from other sources, we will be able to focus on Watt's life as a settler woman with privilege and mobility without sacrificing the context in which she lived and discussed in her own writing.</div><div><br></div><div>Without further ado, enjoy the colorful descriptions of Edmonton's past and think about the people, places, and progress of Edmonton shown in Watt's writing.</div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/womaninwest00wattuoft\" target=\"\" rel=\"\" title=\"Link: https://archive.org/details/womaninwest00wattuoft\">https://archive.org/details/womaninwest00wattuoft</a></div><div><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/towntrail00wattuoft\">https://archive.org/details/towntrail00wattuoft</a><br></div><br><br><br>"}, "type": "overview"}, {"date": "", "location": {"lat": 53.535411, "line": true, "lon": -113.507996, "zoom": 12}, "media": {"caption": "A drawing from Watt's \"The Lure of the Trail\"", "credit": "Internet Archive", "url": "https://ia800204.us.archive.org/BookReader/BookReaderImages.php?zip=/28/items/towntrail00wattuoft/towntrail00wattuoft_jp2.zip&file=towntrail00wattuoft_jp2/towntrail00wattuoft_0015.jp2&id=towntrail00wattuoft&scale=4&rotate=0"}, "text": {"headline": "The Lure of the Trail", "text": "<div>Watt begins <em>Town and Trail</em> with, of course, a narrative about the trail to the \"North and West\", or what we now call Western Canada:</div><div><br></div><div>\"Sometimes in the dark moments you ask yourself why should the trail be broken at all? Why is it so imperative that homes all over the face of the earth should be disorganized, that this new and practically unsettled country should be made to blossom like the rose.

While we can all agree that the Indigenous lands of Treaty 6, 7, and 8 were not \"unsettled\" at any point in settler history, her writing reflects the propaganda of the Canadian and British governments, who painted their settlement schemes as a promising new world for the men brave enough to conquer it.
